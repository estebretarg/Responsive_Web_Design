      <h2>User Lifecycle Management</h2>
      <p>User lifecycle management (ULM) begins the day a candidate accepts a job offer and continues until that employee leaves the company. For HR and IT departments, this means creating user credentials and connecting new employees to cloud resources. User provisioning is the process of creating and managing user
        access to applications and resources in the cloud. Smaller
        organizations might manage these processes manually,
        but when done at scale, the process can become error-prone
        and time-consuming. Automated provisioning does in seconds
        what could typically take an IT staff hours to do manually.</p>
