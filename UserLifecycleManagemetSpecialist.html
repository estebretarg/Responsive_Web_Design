      <h2>User Lifecycle Management</h2>
      <p>User lifecycle management (ULM) begins the day a candidate accepts a job offer and continues until that employee leaves the company. For HR and IT departments, this means creating user credentials and connecting new employees to cloud resources. User provisioning is the process of creating and managing user
        access to applications and resources in the cloud. Smaller
        organizations might manage these processes manually,
        but when done at scale, the process can become error-prone
        and time-consuming. Automated provisioning does in seconds
        what could typically take an IT staff hours to do manually.</p>
        <h2>AD & AAD</h2>
        <h3>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</h3>
        <p>Form the basis of enterprise networks executed in Windows OS <br>
        The AD DS data base is the central store for all objects in the domain, such as user accounts, computer accounts, and groups. <br>
        AD DS provides a searchable hierarchical directory and a method for applying configuration and security settings to objects in an enterprise</p>
        <p>Through AD DS you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Applications installation, configuration, and update.</li>
          <li>Administration of the security infrastructure</li>
          <li>Enabling the remote access service and DirectAccess</li>
          <li>Digital certificates emission and administration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Logic Components</h3>
        <p>AD DS logic components are structures that are used to implement adequate AD DS design for an organization.</p>

          <tr>
            <td>Partition</td>
            <td><p>A partition, or a nomenclature context, is a part of the AD DS database. Although the database consists of a file named Ntds.dit, different partitions contain different data. For example, the schema partition contains a copy of the Active Directory schema. The configuration partition contains the forest configuration objects, and the domain partition contains the domain-specific users, computers, groups, and other objects. Active Directory stores partitions copies in various domain controllers and updates them through directory replication.</p></td>

            <td><p>A domain is a logic administrative container for objects as users and computers. A domain is assigned to an specific partition, and can be organized with principal-secondary relationships respect to other domains.</p></td>
